<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I created this project as a way to learn showcase what I can do and to also be a more unique looking resume. The project helped me learn a lot more than the knowdedge I had started with, especially in regards to how to take into account the dynamic aspects of a webpage with how it responds to different device types.
