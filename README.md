<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kemp3673/Personal-Resume-Site.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. On a Gmail account, go and create an application password.

4. Create an .env file and enter the following
   ```js
   DB_HOST = 'localhost'
   PORT = '<Port you wish to use>'
   EMAIL = '<Email address you wish to receive message to>'
   PASSWORD = '<Google App Password>'
   ```
   
 5. Update src/Data/data.js with your education and employment history.

 7. Update src/images with any images you wish to use.

    - I got the current video from https://www.pexels.com/videos/ which contains royalty-free videos.
